# Practical Deep Learning for Coders Notebooks

This is my copy of Jupyter Notebooks from
[Practical Deep Learning for Coders](https://course.fast.ai/) FastAI course.

It is supposed to be run on your local machine.

I have added minor modifications, to make sure it can be run using the latest versions
of packages.

I have also added notes about what packages needs to be installed and how to install
them in each lesson's README.

## Prerequisites

As this is the first lesson in the course, I recommend creating a Python virtual
environment for the entire course within this repository:

```
pip install virtualenv
virtualenv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Remember to run the last command each time you start working unless you see (.venv)
in your shell prompt.

Next, install the Jupyter Notebook and fastai packages:

```
pip install fastai jupyter
```

That's it! For each lesson in the course, I'll provide commands to install any additional
packages needed.

If you're unsure how to start Jupyter or how to ensure your code can use your GPU, you can
search online for guides on Jupyter and CUDA.
