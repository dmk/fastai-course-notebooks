# Practical Deep Learning for Coders Notebooks

This is my copy of Jupyter Notebooks from [Practical Deep Learning for Coders](https://course.fast.ai/) FastAI course.

It is supposed to be run on your local machine.

I have added minor modifications, to make sure it can be run using the latest versions of packages.

I have also added notes about what packages needs to be installed and how to install them in each lesson's README.
